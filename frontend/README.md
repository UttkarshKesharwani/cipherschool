# CipherStudio (Minimal)

This is a minimal browser-based React IDE prototype named CipherStudio.

Features implemented:

- File explorer to add/delete files
- Sandpack integration to run and preview React code live
- Save and load projects to localStorage using a projectId
- Autosave toggle

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Run dev server:

   npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Notes:

- This is a focused MVP. For production you'd add user auth, persistent backend storage, file/folder hierarchy, improved editor integration (Monaco), and deployment.
